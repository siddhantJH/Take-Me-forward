Web Application for Code Snippets Submission and Display

Project Overview:
This project aims to create a web application that facilitates the submission and display of code snippets. The application consists of two main pages:

1. Submission Form Page (Page 1): This page contains a form where users can submit their code snippets along with relevant information such as username, preferred code language, standard input (stdin), and the source code.

2. Display Entries Page (Page 2): This page displays all the submitted entries in a tabular format, showcasing details such as username, code language, stdin, timestamp of submission, and a truncated version of the source code.

Tech Stack:
Frontend:
  React.js: Used for building the user interface and managing state efficiently.
  HTML/CSS: Used for styling and structuring the web pages.

Backend:
  Express.js: Used as the backend framework for handling HTTP requests, routing, and middleware integration.
  Mongo DB: Used as the database management system for storing user-submitted code snippets and related information.

Functionality:
Submission Form (Page 1):
Users can fill out the form with their details including username, preferred code language, stdin, and source code.
Upon submission, the data is sent to the backend server and stored in the MongoDB database.

Display Entries (Page 2):
Retrieves all the submitted entries from the database and displays them in a tabular format.
The source code is truncated to the initial 100 characters for better readability.


Deployment:
Frontend: Hosted on platforms like Vercel or similar for easy access and deployment.
Backend: Hosted on a server with necessary configurations and environment variables securely set up.
